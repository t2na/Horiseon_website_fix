# Horiseon Website Fix

## Description

The attached project file(s) are for our first challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to take an existing HTML page, along with its associated CSS file, and consolidate the code, such that it would become more logical, structural, and semantically correct, per the latest HTML guidelines. Additionally, we were tasked with making the page more accessible. Some examples include restructuring the css file so that its elements match the flow of the HTML file, consolidating and removing unecessary classifiers, and changing some "div" elements to something more descriptive, like "main" or "nav".

I used this project to test my ability to read and understand HTML and CSS files. By seeking out opportunities to consolidate and correct code, I was able to understand in greater detail what the different aspects of HTML and CSS code pertain to, as well as what qualities they control.
